# Student Attendance System ğŸ“…âœ…

This is a simple Java console project to record and manage student attendance. I built it to practice Java basics like arrays, classes, and user interaction using menus.

## ğŸ”§ What It Can Do

- Add student details (name and roll number)
- Mark students as present or absent
- Show complete attendance report
- Simple menu-based navigation

When you run the program, you'll see options like:
